        <p style="font-family:Georgia, serif;font-size: large;padding-left: 50px; padding-right: 100px;"> Hi! I am currently a sophomore at Case Western Reserve University, studying to get a B.S.E. in <b>Biomedical Engineering with a focus in Biomechancis</b>, as well as a minor in <b>Mechanical Manufacturing and Design</b>. I love creating things, from cooking new dishes to designing and constructing cool things! I have picked up some skills (like welding!) that you can check out in my Maker section below. I enjoy trying new things, and have dabbled in hardware and software, as well as technical and non technical skills!</p>

        <h1 style="text-align:center;font-family:Georgia, serif; font-size: 200%;">Classes!</h1>
        <p style="font-family:Georgia, serif;font-size:large;text-align:center;">Although I have taken many classes, here are the ones I have really enjoyed or found relevant:</p>
        <p style="font-family:Georgia, serif;text-align:left; padding-left: 75px;padding-right: 75px;"><b>Computers in Mechanical Engineering:</b> In this class, we talked about algorithms on a high level, how to work them out by hand, and how to code them with Matlab to handle a multitude of situations. This work would be helpful with data filtering and I learned how to successfully write and debug complex mathematical code.</p>
        <p style="font-family:Georgia, serif;text-align:left; padding-left: 75px;padding-right: 75px;"><b>Mechanical Manufacturing: </b> A great mix of hands on manufacturing and online designing, this class taught me how the basic manufacturing process occurs. Through the Think[Box] fabrication resources, I was able to built a simple hammer made of low grade steel, following design requirements and learning how to use heavy machinery, such as lathes and mills. On the designing aspect, I learned how to use the Solidworks application to create engineering drawings for parts and assemblies, as well as creating them in detail through the program. I got CSWA certified through the class, and plan on becoming certified on a Professional level during my junior year.</p>
        <p style="font-family:Georgia, serif;text-align:left; padding-left: 75px;padding-right: 75px;"><b>Mechanical Engineering Analysis: </b> This class explained the basis of many mechanical engineering problems, such as kinematic and statics problems. I learned the derivations of concepts such as Eigenvalues, Frobenius problems, and Fourier Series. This knowledge will be built upon in future classes as I learn the further application to specific engineering problems.</p>
        <p style="font-family:Georgia, serif;text-align:left; padding-left: 75px;padding-right: 75px;"><b>Elementary Computer Programming: </b> Matlab was first introduced to me in this class, where I mostly importantly learned how it can be used in combination with Arduino and a GUI, to create a fully working product. I enjoyed this class, and how it taught me to communicate well with a group when working on a project with so many moving parts.</p>
        <p style="font-family:Georgia, serif;text-align:left; padding-left: 75px;padding-right: 75px;">Of course I have also taken classes in Circuits, Statics, Physics, Chemistry, Biophysics and Math, all of which have helped me succeed in my more advance classes.</p>
        <p style="font-family:Georgia, serif;text-align:left; padding-left: 75px;padding-right: 75px;">The classes I will be taking in Spring 2023 are Thermodynamics, Dynamics, Calculus, Biophysics, Design and Manufacturing, and a humanities class. </p>

        <h1 style="text-align:center;font-family:Georgia, serif; font-size: 200%;">Workshops!</h1> 
        <p style="font-family:Georgia, serif;font-size:large;text-align:center;">The couple of workshops I have attended, specifically over my high school years, were integral to my understanding of engineering!</p>
        <p style="font-family:Georgia, serif;text-align:left; padding-left: 75px;padding-right: 75px;"><b>Spring Engineering Education Days:</b> When a junior in high school, I attended these SEED days at Santa Clara Univeristy, where I was introduced to engineering as a whole. It was the first time I was exposed to the applications of engineering, specifically Biomedical Engineering. I fell in love with the idea of being able to create, design, manufacture medical devies or prosthetics, or anything that could help people. The fundamentals of problem solving and the excitement that came from that intial introduction have not left me since.</p>
        <p style="font-family:Georgia, serif;text-align:left; padding-left: 75px;padding-right: 75px;"><b>Bioinformatics of Cancer:</b> Through the Rosetta Institute, I did a course talking about the microbiology of cancer, how it spreads, and how researchers are able to use identifiers to find and label genes that are connected to different cancers. From what was taught, I was given an unkown gene and had to research its connection to a cancer, going through online databases and collecting data. This course made me understand that my place was not in a lab, or as a researcher, and I am grateful to have understood that so early on.</p>
        <p style="font-family:Georgia, serif;text-align:left; padding-left: 75px;padding-right: 75px;"><b>The Perry Initiative for Women in Orthopedic Surgery and Engineering:</b> This informative session showed me how doctors, specifically orthopedic surgeons, incorportate technology into their jobs, through means of impressive surgery tech, effective but simple tools, or imaging. It was interesting to see how engineers worked side by side with doctors to develop this tech.</p>

        <h1 style="text-align:center;font-family:Georgia, serif; font-size: 200%;">Clubs!</h1> 
        <p style="font-family:Georgia, serif;text-align:left; padding-left:75px;padding-right: 75px;"> The main engineering club I am in is <b>Robotics</b>! I have been on the team for about a year, and enjoy the wide array of things I get to learn. I work with the NRC micromouse team, which competes in the NASA competition every year. NRC micromouse makes a small robot that can navigate a maze as quickly as possible. This includes designing the pcb and the robot, and writing the code. Here's a couple of things I have done while being on the team! </p>
        <ul style="font-family:Georgia, serif;text-align:left; padding-left:125px;padding-right: 75px;">
            <li><b>Electronics:</b> It was a huge jump going into the club, as there was a lot of electronic work to be done. Last semester, I joined after the PCB had already been designed, so I was introduced to the small parts that had to be soldered on, such as capacitors and resistors. We looked at how to wire the components like the motors and sensors, and I individually stripped and crimped several. This semester, I'm working with the lead of the team to design the PCB, using KiCad, a electronic designing software. This was my first time using it, since I have only ever used Multisim to mimic circuits. Using KiCad allowed me to visualize the components without physically needing them. I helped design the base layout which will be sent out to Polulu and printed before we contineu to work on the board in person. I look forward to using a board this semseter instead of a breadboard like last semester.</li>
            <li><b>Design Testing:</b> When picking out a desing for the robot, there was a lot more thought that went into it than I thought, like how high off the ground we want it, and how the PCB will fit on it. The course also has to be considered, and how it handles the ranges for the different sensors we will mount. Designs have to work with the coding team and the hardware team to ensure that all needs are met. I look forward to testing the robot towards the end of this semster with laser cut maze parts.</li>
            <li><b>Computational:</b> This upcoming semester, with much of the hardware and electronic components finished, I hope to work on the code for the robot, either helping with data filtering from the different type of sensors we have on the robot, or developing the algorithm for the robot to move through the maze with the best speed. The code to read the sensors has already been written but until hardware has a working board, we will not be able to test it.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-family:Georgia, serif;text-align:left; padding-left:75px;padding-right: 75px;"> I am also currently part of The Board Meeting, the skateboarding club on campus, and hope to be a part of the climbing club this semester!</p>

        <h1 style="text-align:center;font-family:Georgia, serif; font-size: 200%;">Experience!</h1> 
        <p style="font-family:Georgia, serif;text-align:left; padding-left:75px;padding-right: 75px;"> A ton of the experience I have working right now is within the food industry or retail! I have learned a ton from these jobs, and they have given me a lot of experience working with very different people, varying in ages, interests, and everything in between. It has taught me how to communicate with everyone, especially when in a high stress situation. I understand how to manage other people, and the importance of being clear. All I learned makes me better equipped to work better in more technical roles since I have had to deal with adapting to a new workplace and learning a completely new set of skills that each of those jobs required. They all demanded a quick pick up, and high quality products or service, which made me a faster learner and taught me to understand the importance of getting the job done.</p>
        <p style="font-family:Georgia, serif;text-align:left; padding-left:75px;padding-right: 75px;"> I also worked as a math tutor for several years as a high schooler. I loved teaching other people and being able to help them understand the fundamentals of math, or teaching them more complication concepts in calculus and how they apply to the real world. I hope to become a Calculus or Programming TA at my school a bit later during my college career.</p>

        <p style="font-family:Georgia, serif;text-align:center;font-size:large">This is all the things I've worked on!</p>
        <p style="font-family:Georgia, serif;text-align:left; padding-left:75px;padding-right: 75px;">This website, of course! Although this is a very simple website, made of just HTML/CSS, I wanted a place to showcase the things I had done and the things I had learned during the process. I was able to get this website relatively quickly, because of its simplicity! A version of the code will be up on my Github, and it will be updated as often as I can. Deploying it was quite easy, as I just used Azure's static website feature. Right now, I'm working on making the URL less ugly.</p>
